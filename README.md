<h1> VMware has ended active development of this project, this repository will no longer be updated.</h1><br># Artifactory Resource

Versions objects in artifactory using the [jfrog cli](https://github.com/JFrogDev/jfrog-cli-go).

## Source Configuration

* `url`: *Required.* The base url of the artifactory server API

* `path`: *Required.* The path to the directory in artifactory

* `user`: *Required.* The artifactory user

* `password`: *Required.* The artifactory password

* `regexp`: *Required.* The regular expression to match the file. There must be a capture group that will match the semver in the filename. For example, `my-app-(.*).tgz` has a capture group which would match files such as

  * `my-app-0.0.1.tgz`
  * `my-app-1.22.3-rc.123.tgz`

## Behavior

### `check`: Extract versions from the bucket.

Objects will be found via the pattern configured by `regexp`. The versions
will be used to order them (using [semver](http://semver.org/)). Each
object's filename is the resulting version.


### `in`: Fetch an object from the bucket.

Places the file fetched from the bucket in the destination.

#### Parameters

* `explode`: *Optional.* If `true`, the downloaded file will be untarred. (Defaults to `false`)

### `out`: Upload an object to the bucket.

Given a file specified by `file`, upload it to the artifactory repo. The new file will be uploaded to the directory that the regex searches in.

#### Parameters

* `file`: *Required.* Path or glob to the file to upload, provided by an output of a task. If multiple files are matched by the glob, an error is raised. The file which
matches will be placed into the directory structure on artifactory as defined by the `path` parameter
in the resource definition. The matching syntax is `bash` glob expansion, so
no capture groups, etc.

## Example Configuration

### Resource Type

You have to add the resource type.

``` yaml
resource_types:
- name: artifactory
  type: docker-image
  source:
    repository: nkcraddock/concourse-artifactory-resource
    tag: latest
```
### Resource

``` yaml
- name: release
  type: artifactory
  source:
    url: https://artifactory.example.org/artifactory
    path: repo/my-app
    regexp: my-app-(.*).tgz
    user: ARTIFACTORY_USER
    password: ARTIFACTORY_PASSWORD
```

### Plan

``` yaml
- get: release
  params: { explode: true }
```

``` yaml
- put: release
  params:
    file: path/to/my-app-*.tgz
```
